## About Me

Full Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable SaaS systems.

I’ve contributed to core platforms used daily by thousands of users, working with companies like Azul Brazilian Airlines, HP, and OrderMyGear. My work spans modern web applications, API design, data integration, and cloud-based production environments.

I build with React and Next.js on the front end, design REST and GraphQL APIs, and focus on performance, reliability, and maintainable architecture. Comfortable working in both legacy systems and new product builds.

**Tech focus:** TypeScript, Next.js, React, Node.js, Java, SQL, GCP.

I care about pragmatic engineering decisions, transparent communication, and building clean systems that scale.
