As a child, I was curious and interested in how things worked, which eventually led me to engineering, where I acquired advanced knowledge of physics, calculus, algebra, geometry, administration and economy. Due to my affinity to computers and gaming, I learned a lot about programming and computer science.

In the background and as a consequence of a solid education, my interdisciplinary knowledge is broad and rich (biology, geography, music, gastronomy, philosophy, psychology, and so forth).

In tech, my preferred role is BackEnd, and my greatest interests revolve around game development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
